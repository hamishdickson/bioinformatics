# Helix

A bioinformatics library written in scala.

## Project status

I am actively working on this library at the moment, it is far from complete and of course and help/questions/comments
are appreciated.

## Rosalind

Full credit to this library goes to the [Rosalind project](http://rosalind.info/about/) which has basically taught me
all the bioinformatics I know.

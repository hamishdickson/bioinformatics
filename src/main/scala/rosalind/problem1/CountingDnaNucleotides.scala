 * A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length 
 * of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.
 * 
 * An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."
 * 
 * Create a function with the following attributes:
 * takes:  A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.
 * returns: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.
